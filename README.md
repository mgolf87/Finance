### Stochastic Relative Strength Index - StochRSI
#### StochRSI.ipynb 
Finds if an asset is overbought or oversold via Stochastic RSI
<br />
When a stock goes above 0.8 = good time to sell
<br />
When a stock goes below 0.2 = good time to buy
<br />
<br />
Uses an exponential moving average indicator function (EMA) and a Stochastic RSI function (StochRSI) to plot the closing price and the StochRSI. Oversold (0.2) and Overbought (0.8) lines on the StochRSI graph indicate that when a stock goes above 0.8 it suggests it’s a good time to sell, and when a stock goes below 0.2 it suggests it’s a good time to buy. Comparing the values of the closing prices above and below the overbought and oversold lines indicate whether the decision to sell or buy was correct.
